# Known Postman Collection

This is a Postman collection, together with a local example environment, for communicating with the Known API.

## Authorisation

This uses the OAuth2 server which is built in to the Known API. 

To make full advantage of this, be sure to ask for `openid profile email` as scopes.

##Â Usage

* Download Postman
* Download Docker
* Import the collection, and optional Localhost environment
* Checkout Known and start up the Developer Docker install 
* Start poking the API!
